# SSL/TLS Certificates
This directory is meant for storing the certificates used for the dev and prod environments

If you are adding a certificate which does not match any of the names provided in the `.gitignore` file, please make sure to add its name to the file. This will prevent possible merge conflicts from happening when the CD script is run. 

NGINX is set to work with `.crt` and `.key`
