    # For Nginx, we are going to rely on the docker ingress network and routing mesh to send traffic to our nginx
    # instances. We are doing so in order to use a "start-first" update config. If we used `mode: host, and bypassed
    # the routing mesh, when we redeploy nginx we would get "port already in use", as this update config will try to
    # spin up a new instance before removing the old one (rolling release)
