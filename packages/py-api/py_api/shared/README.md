## Shared
This directory is designated to store all log files that are produced by the API's loggers. The intention is to create a shared volume between the container and the underlying server that hosts the Docker container. This approach ensures that the log files persist instead of being deleted whenever the continuous delivery pipeline executes and recreates the container. Furthermore, organizing the logs in this manner will allow us to establish an endpoint for reading the logs and retrieving the output. Additionally, it will grant us the capability to access the server via SSH to review the logs.
