Don’t forget to create a diverse team, as the best teams usually incorporate programmers, business planners, and designers. The teams should be between 4 and 6 people. However, if you have less, don’t worry! Organizers from the Hub will add you to the best suited team for you. Don’t procrastinate registering, because if the registered teams become more than 12, your team will be waitlisted until the very last week before the competition.",
