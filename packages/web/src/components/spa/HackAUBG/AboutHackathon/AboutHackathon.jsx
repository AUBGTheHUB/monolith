                    Welcome to HackAUBG 5.0 - the ultimate 52-hour hackathon
                    experience organized by The Hub. At HackAUBG, our goal is to
                    provide a platform for students, professionals, and
                    entrepreneurs to come together and develop solutions for
                    real-world problems. Whether you’re a programmer, a
                    designer, or simply have an interest in tech or business, we
                    welcome you to join us and put your skills to the test.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Over the course of 52 hours, you will work in teams to
                    brainstorm and prototype your project idea based on the
                    topic we will reveal during the Opening Ceremony, as well as
                    pitch your project to a panel of judges. But you won’t be on
                    your own - we will have a team of experienced mentors on
                    hand to offer guidance and support throughout the event.
                    Plus, there will be awesome prizes and food to keep you
                    fueled and motivated!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    HackAUBG is more than just a hackathon - it’s a community of
                    innovators, collaborators, and problem-solvers. We believe
                    that together, we can create a better future through
                    technology and creativity.
