class TransactionManager:
    """This class is responsible for executing multiple mongo db queries such as insert_one or update_on in a
    transactional context. It manages operations such as starting, commiting, aborting and retrying a transaction.
    The terms you will see in the code below:

    `session` - a Mongo ClientSession provides the context in which to execute multiple operations in a specific
    sequence, isolating them from operations in other sessions and transactions to prevent conflicts and maintain data
    consistency. In other words the session provides Causal Consistency to the operations in the transaction.
    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#causal-consistency

    `transaction` - Ensures atomicity within this session context, meaning that all operations in the sequence succeed
    together or fail together. If any operation fails, the entire sequence is rolled back, so changes to the database
    are not made

        """
        A generic method used for executing a callback in a transaction. This method is generic as we want the
        with_transaction method to have the return type of the passed callback function. The method is responsible for
        starting a transaction and commiting it. In case of an Exception the transaction is automatically aborted.

        Note: The default with_transaction method from the `motor` library will stop retrying the transaction after 120 seconds
        have elapsed. However, since we want a shorter duration until the transaction is aborted, we have implemented a _retry_tx
        method and _retry_commit method that will abort the transaction when the maximum number of retries is reached in any of
        the retry methods.

        The ``callback`` could be a function grouping multiple operations. For example::

        async def callback(session):
            await participants.insert_one({"test":"test"} session=session)
            await teams.update_one({"test":"test"} session=session)
